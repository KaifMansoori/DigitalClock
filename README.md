# DigitalClock
A Modern Digital Clock App

## Description
        
This web app is designed to display the current time and date in a digital clock format using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to its primary function as a clock, it also generates a README.md file that can be used to provide documentation for your project on Github or other platforms.

To use the Digital Clock Website, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The current time and date will be displayed in the center of the screen in a large, easy-to-read format. The clock is updated every second to ensure that it always displays the correct time.
